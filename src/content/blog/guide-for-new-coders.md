While coding remember the following

## Git

- Give precise and elaborate commit message.
- Work on a separate branch unless mentioned.

```bash
git checkout -b new_branch_name
```

## Laravel

- You can add new images directly in Public folder and refer it as a normal file inside the blade file.
