I deal with multiple projects every day, and I used to juggle between them. However, I've found that the best way to be productive is to focus on one thing at a time.

When we try to multitask, we're actually switching our attention back and forth between tasks, which takes time and effort. This can lead to errors, decreased productivity, and increased stress.

Instead, it's better to focus on one task at a time and give it our full attention. This allows us to get into a flow state, where we're able to work more efficiently and effectively.

Here are a few tips for focusing on one thing at a time:

- Plan your day ahead of time. Decide what you need to accomplish, and then break down each task into smaller steps.
- Set aside time for each task. 
- Don't try to multitask.
- Eliminate distractions. Especially meetings. Move all your meeting to the end of the day (If that's possible).
- Take breaks. Get up and move around every 20-30 minutes.
- Break down large tasks into smaller steps.
