**Not using screens at night**

I had a bad habit of watching mobile at night after going to bed. It affected the quality of my sleep and my eyes. So I decided last year to stop it. In the beginning I substituted my urge to watch the mobile with listening to music. Then slowly I stopped reaching my mobile. I want to continue the same. No screen before and during bed. 

**Restricted social media**

When I tracked my social media usage, Instagram and YouTube added for more than 16 hrs per week. That’s two days of productive work. Scrolling them sneaked into my focus and productive times. Totally stopping them won’t happen so I restricted the usage time. 5 min per day for Instagram. 15 min per day for YouTube. I could stick with the times. Stopped putting phone beside me during work. That’s helping. 

**Reading books**

I completed two books last year. I want to complete two more this year. One nonfiction and one about Indian history.
