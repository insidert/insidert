- Present yourself well. Take a headbath and make sure you are dressed well. At least the top part.
- Go to a place where there are near zero distractions. 
- A well lit place is necessary. You should have the light source in a way that you face is well lit.
- Check the microphones of your devices. A bad sound quality is very unacceptable. People may compromise on the video but won't on audio.
- List of the topics you want to discuss.
- Prepare a good introduction about yourself. 
- Dive into the topics according to the list prepared.
- Have closing anchors. Like subscribing to your channels or newsletter.
