The cost of appealing to everyone is higher than appealing to a niche. Be it personal or professional.

You do not have to please everyone. Everyone does not have to like you.

Your product is not for everyone. If it’s for everyone, we have to find ways that our product fits for everyone’s interest. That is a very broad specturm to cover. And that's costly.
