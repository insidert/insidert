I have very bad experience renewing apple developer account subscription. Before it used to accept credit cards. But since 2023 they are not accepting credit cards. There are only two options left.

UPI & Netbanking.

I did not try net banking but used UPI. To renew follow these steps.

## Add payment method 

You need to add your Google Pay UPI id.

- Go to your iPhone > setting > click on your apple account at the top

- Click on payment & shipping

- Use Google Pay UPI id. If you do not have it, you can add it by clicking on "Add payment method."

## Start the process

- Login to your mac and go to settings. (I recommend mac instead of iPhone.)

- Go to system settings > click on your account at the top.

- Go to media and purchases > Click on manage at subscriptions.

- There you will see your subscriptions. Click on Apple developer.

- The new screen will show the Google Pay UPI id. The mandate is created.

- Google pay will get the notification and proceed with your pin.

That's it.

I tried with CRED many times but it did not go through. After a google search, a comment in apple forum pointed that only Google Pay works.

So, Google Pay to the rescue.
