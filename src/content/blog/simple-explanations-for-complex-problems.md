Us, humans are simplifying beings. That’s how we evolved. If we don’t understand something, we create a story around it to be meaningful. We cannot survive long psychologically if we don’t understand and had to deal with it. Imagine, the cave man days and there’s a rain fall for almost a week, now what’s might be going inside the cave men head? They don’t know anything of rains, why and how they are formed. They are stuck inside the caves for days without food. The family or tribe are starving and what can they do? Nothing. Absolutely nothing. But to understand the situation what can they do? Frame a story around it and talk about it. Someone might be angry at them. Nature is angry at them for their doings. And so they come up with rituals that make them pacify. They can extend these to next levels.

Even now we do it. Just observe your thinking.
