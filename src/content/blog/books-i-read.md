The list in the order of my completion.

- Life is what you make it. 
    - This is my first book. I considered buying one on a friend's recommendation who is fond of reading books. When I was searching through Flipkart, I got this book at a deal. I thought of not spending too much on a book as I was hesitant in the beginning. It's a fictional writing about a girl who is diagnosed with bi-polar disease and how she overcome the hurdles and made her own way of life. And hence the title. Life is what you make it. It was a good one and then I decided not to go fictional writings as I thought more fiction is going in my life at that point.
