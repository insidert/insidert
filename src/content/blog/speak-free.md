Naval Ravikant once tweeted, “If you don’t want to be liked, they can’t touch you.” There’s a deeper thinking to it. Often time, agreeable people cannot speak to their hearts. They always think what the other person might think about them and also don’t want to be hated. As a result, they cannot speak free. Or at least something that bring some tension and conflict. This is okay a few time but not a good strategy in the long run. 

If you want to speak freely, don’t worry about how others perceive you. That’s a superpower and comes handy at times. 

If we keep silent and stop taking, people take it for granted. When we fight back when needed, people think of it as new dimension and gets freaked out. This usually happens in the family.
