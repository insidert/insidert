There comes a time where we move beyond our comfort zone. Most of the times it is because of necessity. I have done the same a few days ago. I started actively doing reels for Instagram. They are not for my personal account but for MF7. If there’s no marketing, the product/service will die. Whatever it takes, do it to keep it alive. It’s a necessity and so I have come beyond my comfort zone, my introversion zone.
