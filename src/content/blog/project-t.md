Project-T is the working title of our next product. It is a platform that connects owners and tenants and helps manage the entire renting life cycle.

##### It’s nothing new, but why now?
I am on both sides; as an owner and as a tenant. I still see gaps in how interactions happen between the two parties. This product can also serve geographical areas that existing players have left out.

##### Seems you will likely fail.
Yes, there are many odds stacked against success. But I can see some ways the product can win. I don't want to capture the whole universe — I just want to make a small dent.

##### You may not capture a good market size.
The total addressable market is huge. It will show interesting behaviours, and that makes the journey exciting — to discover which segment will welcome the product and embrace it.

##### There are giants. They can replace you.
Yes. As I said, I want to start with the smallest possible market. I am betting on them.

##### How do you satisfy both tenants and owners at the same time?
That is one of the hardest problems — balancing the needs of both sides while also addressing the cold-start challenge.

##### What are the revenue channels?
I will charge both parties, but roll it out incrementally; starting with owners, as they are more willing to pay for such services.

##### What differentiation will you have?
Most existing platforms act as lead magnets for real estate companies and focus on subscriptions, cross-selling, and up-selling. They are not deeply invested in solving the core problems.

My key differentiators are:

A pre-matching system between owners and tenants to reduce unnecessary calls and repetitive questions. Not putting owner contact information behind a paywall - at least to start with.

##### Why are you doing this project?
I don’t want owners to wait months for their property to be occupied, and I don’t want tenants to waste time, money, and physical efforts to find the right owner.

##### What pain are you solving?
The pain of owners who struggle to rent out quickly.
The pain of tenants who spend too much time speaking to owners just to figure out if it's even a potential match.

##### When is the launch?
The MVP is ready. A few polishings are left. Soft launch is on December 1.
