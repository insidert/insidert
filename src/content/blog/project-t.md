Project-T is the working title of our next product. It is a platform that connects owners and tenants and helps manage the entire renting life cycle.

##### What differentiation will you have?
Most existing platforms act as lead magnets for real estate companies and focus on subscriptions, cross-selling, and up-selling. They are not deeply invested in solving the core problems.

My key differentiator is a pre-matching system between owners and tenants to reduce unnecessary calls and repetitive questions. 

##### Why are you doing this project?
I don’t want owners to wait months for their property to be occupied and I don’t want tenants to waste time, money, and physical efforts to find the right owner.

##### What pain are you solving?
The pain of owners who struggle to rent out quickly.
The pain of tenants who spend too much time speaking to owners just to figure out if it's even a potential match.

##### It’s nothing new, but why now?
I am on both sides; as an owner and as a tenant. I still see gaps in how interactions happen between the two parties. This product can also serve geographical areas that existing players have left out.

##### Seems you will likely fail.
Yes, there are many odds stacked against success. But I can see some ways the product can win. I don't want to capture the whole universe — I just want to make a small dent.

##### You may not capture a good market size.
The total addressable market is huge. It will show interesting behaviours, and that makes the journey exciting. That is to discover which segment will welcome the product and embrace it.

##### There are giants. They can replace you.
Yes. It can happen. But I will try to be more authentic in solving the problem and make the difference.

##### How do you satisfy both tenants and owners at the same time?
That is one of the hardest problems. But I am excited. I have to balance the needs of both sides. But I will figure that out in the journey.

##### When is the launch?
The MVP is ready. A few polishings are left. Soft launch is on December 1.
