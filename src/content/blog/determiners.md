Names carry a history. They determine a value and weight. They determine some past, some good and some bad. A group identified with a name comes with attributes. 

Your surname is a determiner. Your religion is a determiner. Your caste, if you believe in them, is a determiner. All of them comes with a name. All of them comes with a baggage. 

The determiners simplifies judgement. Thatâ€™s what most people do. 

Why should we do it? To simplify our understanding and make explanations. To simplify our judgement. To think less.
